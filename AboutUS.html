                People <i class="fa-duotone fa-alien"></i> often
                discard clothing items when they are no longer in
                use. They buy clothing
                from malls, online retail stores, or regular
                neighborhood stores and later, when these
                clothes outgrow their utility, they throw them away
                or dump them in bins. This has
                even happened in the case of high cost clothing.
                People who can afford expensive
                fashion typically do not like to repeat their
                outfits. They move on to buy newer items
                barely after using current items on two or three
                occasions. The older ones are then just
                discarded. This causes burden on the planet because
                as the number of such discarded
                fashion (which is still in good condition,
                nevertheless) increases, the effort to dispose
                them also increases.
                These days, recycling, sustainability, and reuse are
                not just buzzwords, but actionable
                behaviors to support a better planet. Instead of
                discarding clothes that are still in good
                condition, but no longer required by the original
                buyers, these clothes can be sold as
                thrift fashion or pre-used clothing.
                In simple terms, shopping for thrift fashion is
                second hand purchases for fashionable
                clothing.
                This supports the theme of recycling and
                sustainability and is also affordable by many
                who otherwise could not purchase new fashionable
                clothing.</div>
