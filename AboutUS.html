				<p> People often discard clothing items when they are no longer in use. They buy clothing from malls, online retail stores, or regular neighborhood stores and later, when these clothes outgrow their utility, they throw them away or dump them in bins. This has even happened in the case of high cost clothing. People who can afford expensive fashion typically do not like to repeat their outfits. They move on to buy newer items barely after using current items on two or three occasions. The older ones are then just discarded. This causes burden on the planet because as the number of such discarded fashion (which is still in good condition, nevertheless) increases, the effort to dispose them also increases. These days, recycling, sustainability, and reuse are not just buzzwords, but actionable behaviors to support a better planet. Instead of discarding clothes that are still in good condition, but no longer required by the original buyers, these clothes can be sold as thrift fashion or pre-used clothing. In simple terms, shopping for thrift fashion is second hand purchases for fashionable clothing. This supports the theme of recycling and sustainability and is also affordable by many who otherwise could not purchase new fashionable clothing. </p>
