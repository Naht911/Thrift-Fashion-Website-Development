                    People <i class="fa-duotone fa-alien"></i> often discard clothing items when they are no longer in
                    use. They buy clothing
                    from malls, online retail stores, or regular neighborhood stores and later, when these
                    clothes outgrow their utility, they throw them away or dump them in bins. This has
                    even happened in the case of high cost clothing. People who can afford expensive
                    fashion typically do not like to repeat their outfits. They move on to buy newer items
                    barely after using current items on two or three occasions. The older ones are then just
                    discarded. This causes burden on the planet because as the number of such discarded
                    fashion (which is still in good condition, nevertheless) increases, the effort to dispose
                    them also increases.
                    These days, recycling, sustainability, and reuse are not just buzzwords, but actionable
                    behaviors to support a better planet. Instead of discarding clothes that are still in good
                    condition, but no longer required by the original buyers, these clothes can be sold as
                    thrift fashion or pre-used clothing.
                    In simple terms, shopping for thrift fashion is second hand purchases for fashionable
                    clothing.
                    This supports the theme of recycling and sustainability and is also affordable by many
                    who otherwise could not purchase new fashionable clothing.</div>
